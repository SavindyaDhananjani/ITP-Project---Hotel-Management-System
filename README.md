#### Brief Description of Project -

Hotel management system also provides a unique platform where customers can do quick self-service by ordering the food themselves using KIOSK menu. HMS also provides delivery services this is an additional service due to the COVID pandemic situation where each order is assigned to a rider. While reserving halls and rooms customers can check availability of hall/room. An event calendar is also provided by the system which has event reminders. There are special packages for different events and the customers can select food according to the event and the price is calculated per plate. Users can rate the Hotel or provide feedback about the services. Manager registers the employees to the system. The employees can view special notices about salary increments and bonus by logging into the system. The finance department manages all the expenses and incomes also generates monthly and yearly reports which is displayed in the system using BI dashboard. The head chef has to keep a record of the inventory and gets notification when items are out of stock so that he can contact the suppliers and reorder stock. HMS is a user friendly system.  The system also has a site map of the hotel and customers have the privilege to take a virtual hotel tour by viewing the hotel gallery. For knowing additional details about the hotel customers can either send a mail, contact the hotel or call them. HMS is designed with the aim of providing the best services and customer satisfaction.
